# Form Resubmission Fix - POST/Redirect/GET Pattern

## Issue Fixed

After uploading or deleting a resource, refreshing the page showed a browser warning:

> "The page that you're looking for used information that you entered. Returning to that page might cause any action you took to be repeated. Do you want to continue?"

This warning appears because the browser is trying to resubmit the POST data when you refresh.

## Solution: POST/Redirect/GET (PRG) Pattern

The POST/Redirect/GET pattern prevents form resubmission by:

1. Processing the POST request
2. Storing success/error messages in the session
3. Redirecting to the same page with GET request
4. Displaying the messages from session
5. Clearing the session messages

## Changes Made

### 1. Teacher Resources Page (`teacher/resources.php`)

#### Upload Success Flow:

**Before:**

```php
$upload_success = true;
$_SESSION['success_message'] = "Resource uploaded successfully!";
// Page continues loading with POST data
```

**After:**

```php
$_SESSION['success_message'] = "Resource uploaded successfully!";
// Redirect to prevent form resubmission
header('Location: resources.php');
exit;
```

#### Upload Error Flow:

**Before:**

```php
$upload_error = "Error message";
// Page continues loading with POST data
```

**After:**

```php
// If there's an error, store it in session and redirect
if (!empty($upload_error)) {
    $_SESSION['upload_error'] = $upload_error;
    header('Location: resources.php');
    exit;
}
```

#### Delete Flow:

**Before:**

```php
$upload_success = true;
$_SESSION['success_message'] = "Resource deleted successfully!";
// Page continues
```

**After:**

```php
$_SESSION['success_message'] = "Resource deleted successfully!";
// Redirect after delete to prevent resubmission
header('Location: resources.php');
exit;
```

#### Session Message Retrieval:

**Added at the top of the page:**

```php
// Check for session messages
$upload_error = '';
if (isset($_SESSION['upload_error'])) {
    $upload_error = $_SESSION['upload_error'];
    unset($_SESSION['upload_error']);
}

$success_message = '';
if (isset($_SESSION['success_message'])) {
    $success_message = $_SESSION['success_message'];
    unset($_SESSION['success_message']);
}
```

#### Display Updated:

**Before:**

```php
<?php if (isset($_SESSION['success_message'])): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SESSION['success_message']); unset($_SESSION['success_message']); ?>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

**After:**

```php
<?php if ($success_message): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        <?php echo htmlspecialchars($success_message); ?>
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

### 2. Admin Resources Page (`admin/resources.php`)

Applied the same POST/Redirect/GET pattern with identical changes.

## How It Works Now

### Upload Flow:

1. User fills form and submits (POST)
2. Server processes upload
3. If successful:
   - Stores success message in `$_SESSION['success_message']`
   - Redirects to `resources.php` (GET)
4. If error:
   - Stores error in `$_SESSION['upload_error']`
   - Redirects to `resources.php` (GET)
5. Page loads with GET request
6. Retrieves message from session
7. Displays message
8. Clears session message
9. **User can now refresh safely** - no POST data to resubmit!

### Delete Flow:

1. User clicks delete button (POST)
2. Server deletes resource
3. Stores success/error message in session
4. Redirects to `resources.php` (GET)
5. Page displays message from session
6. **User can refresh safely** - no resubmission

## Benefits

âœ… **No More Duplicate Submissions** - Refreshing won't create duplicate entries
âœ… **Better UX** - No browser warnings about resubmitting forms
âœ… **Cleaner URLs** - After action, URL is clean GET request
âœ… **Session-Based Messaging** - Messages persist across redirect
âœ… **Standard Web Practice** - Following PRG pattern best practice

## Testing

### Test Upload:

1. Go to Teacher/Admin Resources
2. Upload a file
3. Wait for success message
4. **Press F5 (refresh)** - No warning, no duplicate upload
5. Success message disappears (as designed)

### Test Delete:

1. Click delete on any resource
2. Confirm deletion
3. Wait for success message
4. **Press F5 (refresh)** - No warning, no duplicate delete
5. Success message disappears

### Test Error Handling:

1. Try uploading a file over 50MB
2. You'll see error message
3. **Press F5 (refresh)** - No warning, error clears

## Additional Schema Fixes Applied

While fixing the resubmission issue, also applied the database schema compatibility fixes:

- Changed column names to match existing database
- Updated category handling to use predefined array
- Fixed all SQL queries for notes, ebooks, and pastpapers

## Files Modified

1. `teacher/resources.php` - POST/Redirect/GET + Schema fixes
2. `admin/resources.php` - POST/Redirect/GET + Schema fixes

Both files now:

- âœ… Prevent form resubmission
- âœ… Work with existing database schema
- âœ… Display proper success/error messages
- âœ… Follow web development best practices

## Conclusion

The form resubmission issue is completely resolved. Users can now:

- Upload resources without worrying about duplicates on refresh
- Delete resources safely
- See clear success/error messages
- Navigate back/forward without warnings
- Refresh the page anytime without issues

This is a production-ready implementation of the POST/Redirect/GET pattern! ðŸŽ‰
