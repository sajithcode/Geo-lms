# Student Learning Resources Fix

## Issue Fixed

Student learning resource pages (Notes, E-Books, Past Papers) were not showing resources correctly because they were using the wrong database schema.

## Problems Found:

### 1. **pages/notes.php**

- ❌ Using old schema: `category_id`, `note_id`, `file_size`, `download_count`, `view_count`
- ❌ Trying to join `resource_categories` table that doesn't exist
- ❌ Trying to get ratings from non-existent `resource_ratings` table

### 2. **pages/e-books.php**

- ❌ Not using database at all - was looking for files in `/assets/ebooks/` directory
- ❌ Showing file system files instead of database records

### 3. **pages/pastpapers.php**

- ❌ Not using database at all - was looking for files in `/assets/pastpapers/` directory
- ❌ Showing file system files instead of database records

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. **pages/notes.php** - Updated to Current Schema

✅ Changed `category_id` → `category` (varchar field)
✅ Changed `note_id` → `id`
✅ Changed `file_size` → `filesize`

✅ Removed `view_count` (column doesn't exist)
✅ Removed `resource_categories` table JOIN
✅ Removed ratings functionality (table doesn't exist)
✅ Uses predefined category array
✅ Proper search and filter functionality
✅ Display shows: category, file size, download count, upload date

✅ Filter by category
✅ Sort by: Recent, Popular, Title
✅ Shows author information
✅ Displays proper file information from database
✅ Uses correct column names: `id`, `filepath`, `filesize`, `downloads`, `category`

### 3. **pages/pastpapers.php** - Complete Rewrite
