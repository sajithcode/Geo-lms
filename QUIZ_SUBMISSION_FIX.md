# Quiz Submission Fix - Complete! ✅

## Problem Identified

**Error:** `Fatal error: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'correct_answers' in 'field list'`

**Location:** `submit_quiz.php` line 162

**Root Cause:**

- Code was trying to insert into `correct_answers` column
- This column doesn't exist in your `quiz_attempts` table
- Code wasn't checking if the column exists before using it

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### **Before (Broken):**

```php
// Always tried to insert correct_answers column
$sql_insert = "INSERT INTO quiz_attempts (user_id, quiz_id, score, correct_answers";
$params = [$user_id, $quiz_id, $percentage_score, $correct_count];
```

### **After (Fixed):**

```php
// Check if correct_answers column exists
$columns_correct = $pdo->query("SHOW COLUMNS FROM quiz_attempts LIKE 'correct_answers'")->fetchAll();
$has_correct_answers = count($columns_correct) > 0;

// Build dynamic INSERT query
$sql_columns = ['user_id', 'quiz_id', 'score'];
$params = [$user_id, $quiz_id, $percentage_score];

// Only add correct_answers if column exists
if ($has_correct_answers) {
    $sql_columns[] = 'correct_answers';
    $params[] = $correct_count;
}

// Same for other optional columns (passed, time_spent, started_at)
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

### Database Compatibility

✅ **Checks column existence** before inserting
✅ **Dynamic SQL queries** adapt to your table structure
✅ **Works with minimal table** (only user_id, quiz_id, score required)
✅ **Supports optional columns** (correct_answers, passed, time_spent, started_at)

### Quiz Functionality

✅ **Submissions save correctly** to database
✅ **Redirects to results page** after submission
✅ **No more SQL errors** on submit
✅ **Calculates scores properly**
✅ **Tracks pass/fail status**

## 📊 Minimum Required Columns

Your `quiz_attempts` table needs at minimum:

```sql
- attempt_id (PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
- user_id (INT)
- quiz_id (INT)
- score (DECIMAL or FLOAT)
```

### Optional Columns (Auto-detected):

```sql
- correct_answers (INT) - number of correct answers
- passed (TINYINT) - 1 if passed, 0 if failed
- time_spent (INT) - seconds spent on quiz
- started_at (DATETIME) - when quiz was started
- created_at (TIMESTAMP) - when attempt was recorded
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **Student takes quiz** → Answers questions
2. **Submits quiz** → Form posts to `submit_quiz.php`
3. **Score calculated** → Correct answers counted, percentage computed
4. **Column check** → System checks which columns exist in database
5. **Dynamic INSERT** → Only inserts into columns that exist
6. **Save attempt** → Record saved successfully
7. **Redirect** → Student sees results page with their score

## 🧪 Testing Results

✅ Submit quiz with minimal database table
✅ Submit quiz with full database table
✅ Score calculation works correctly
✅ Redirects to results page
✅ Results display properly
✅ Multiple quiz attempts tracked
✅ Time tracking works (if column exists)
✅ Pass/fail status calculated (if column exists)

## 📝 If You Want Full Features

To enable all features, add these columns to `quiz_attempts`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE quiz_attempts
ADD COLUMN correct_answers INT DEFAULT 0 AFTER score;

ALTER TABLE quiz_attempts
ADD COLUMN passed TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0 AFTER correct_answers;

ALTER TABLE quiz_attempts
ADD COLUMN time_spent INT DEFAULT 0 AFTER passed;

ALTER TABLE quiz_attempts
ADD COLUMN started_at DATETIME DEFAULT NULL AFTER time_spent;
```

But the system **works without them** - it just won't store that extra information.
